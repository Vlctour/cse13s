Some projects I did for a class in college at UCSC, here are some projects that are of interest that I worked on:

## ASGN3 - Sorting Algorithm Tests (Insertion, Heap, Quick, Batcher)
This assignment involves generating numbers and correctly sorting them. This assignment also includes debugging tools to analyze the efficiency 
of each sorting algorithm under certain conditions.

## ASGN4 - Game of Life
This program allows the user to insert a file to play the game of life. This file should only contain two positive numbers per line, namely rows and columns. The program will take the input and set the playing grid to be whatever was specified. The remaining rows and column pairs will be used to populate the grid and act as the starting generation.

## ASGN5 - Public Key Cryptography
The purpose of these programs is to create a secure way to allow messages to be passed around so that only specific people can read the messages using RSA encryption/decryption.

## ASGN6 - Huffman Encoding
The purpose of this program is to create a lossless compression algorithm to better allow users to transfer massive files without losing data.

## ASGN7 - Author Identification
The purpose of this program is to identify how closely related a users' writing is to one of the authors stored in the database. It utilizes a SPECK Cipher for the hashing for our hash table and also a priority queue (using heap insertion) to give us the top k likely authors that matches the users.
